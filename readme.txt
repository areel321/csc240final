For my final project I chose to do an animation. My first thought was to do something with the staypuff marshmallow man from ghostbusters and have him cause destruction in a city like in the movie. I couldn't find a gltf marshmallow man that I loved, but I found this one that I thought was really cute and my idea shifted to being more inspired by the pixar intro of the lamp jumping on the i. I wanted to achieve kind of that same animation with the building, and I added a flower to the marshmallow to show hierarchical modeling. I found the flower and marshmallow objects online and I made the building myself in blender. 
The storyline of my animation is that there is a marshmallow who picks up a flower, walks down the street, encounters a building, and decides to crush it.
